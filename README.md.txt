NYC Temperature and Taxi Service Correlation by Massuod Soofizada


Hello to all accessing this GitHub repository. This is my upload of my project for CIS 4130 Big Data Technologies
at Baruch College. This is where I will give a brief explanation of my project and what exactly you will be 
seeing. My project is one that puts two datasets, NYC weather data and NYC taxi cab data against each other
in order to predict if the amount of rides on a given day were above or below the average number of rides for
the whole month. Once you access the file containing all the information of my project, it will include all 
of the soruce code I used from downloading my datasets to creating visualizations of the results of building
my logistic regression model.
